                    <p class="">Mais oui ! Enfin, on peut parler de prendre les présences avec des statuts que VOUS
                        définissez depuis une page de configuration. Vous pouvez modifier, supprimer, mais surtout créer
                        vos propres statuts que vous retrouverez lors de la prise des présences et dans de nombreux
                        graphiques avec un code couleur personnalisable.</p>
